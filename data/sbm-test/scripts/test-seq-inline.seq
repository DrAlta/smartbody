###  test-seq-inline.seq
###
###  Demos / Tests "seq <name> inline" command
###  Should run inline1, 2, & 3 in parallel,
###  but from withing this parent scripts srCmdSeq.
###  Thus, the children should abort when this aborts.

0	echo Running test-seq-inline

0	echo Starting three inline statements
0	echo - execution of children in parallel (longest is 3sec)
0	echo - if times are the same, the first inlined is the first executed
0	seq delay1sec inline
0	seq delay2sec inline
0	seq delay3sec inline

###		Grrr.... Can't abort self without crashing (invalid iterator reference)
#2.5	echo Aborting test-seq-chain before delay3sec completes
#2.5	seq test-seq-inline abort
