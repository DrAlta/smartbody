###  sbm-testdata/test-audiofile-speech.seq
###
###  This sequence demonstrates hoe to use audiofile
###  speech with lip syncing.  You'll need to use a
###  renderer that support visemes and an audio
###  playback module (such as SBM's -audio option).
###
###  Assume SBM's current directory is
###    core/smartbody/sbm/bin


###  Set the voice type to audiofile
###  and choose a directory for audio and .ltf files.
###  Note: the directory assumes trunk is named smartbody
0	set character doctor voice audiofile trunk/data/sbm-testdata/speech_audio/boy


###  Audiofile speech uses BML's ref= attribute
###  to identify the phoneme file and audio
2   test bml char doctor <speech ref="hey"/>

###  String contents are currently ignored.
5   test bml char doctor <speech ref="hello">hey</speech>

###  Sync points work like normal.
8   test bml char doctor <speech id="yes" ref="yes"/><head type="NOD" amount="0.5" start="yes:end"/>
12   test bml char doctor <speech id="no" ref="no"/><head type="SHAKE" amount="0.5" start="no:end"/>
