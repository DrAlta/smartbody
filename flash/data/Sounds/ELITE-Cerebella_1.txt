Welcome to your training. This is the Emergent Leader Immersive Training Environment or ELITE. It's gonna help you improve the way you communicate with people, which will help you be a better leader. And that helps everybody. So pay attention. Over the next hour or so this system's gonna take you through basic counseling skills that will likely come in handy when you rotate into your next assignment. These skills will help you respond when a Soldier has a performance problem that you need to address or if a Soldier brings a personal problem to you.
