###  sbm-testdata/test-audiofile-speech.seq
###
###  This sequence demonstrates how to use RemoteSpeech
###  speech with lip syncing.  You'll need to use a
###  renderer that support visemes and an audio
###  playback module (such as SBM's -audio option).
###
###  Assume a RemoteSpeech server is running,
###  connected to the VHMsg server on the same scope.


###  Set the voice type to remote
###  and choose voice "M021" (for Rheotrical's RVoice synthesis).
0	set character doctor voice remote M021


###  Audiofile speech uses BML's ref= attribute
###  to identify the phoneme file and audio
2   test bml char doctor <speech>Hey</speech>

###  String contents are currently ignored.
5   test bml char doctor <speech>Hello</speech>

###  Sync points work like normal.
8   test bml char doctor <speech id="yes">Yes</speech><head type="NOD" amount="0.5" start="yes:end"/>
12   test bml char doctor <speech id="no">No</speech><head type="SHAKE" amount="0.5" start="no:end"/>
