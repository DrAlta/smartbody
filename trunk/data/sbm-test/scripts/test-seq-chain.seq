###  test-seq-chain
###
###  Tests / Demos seq-chain capabilities
###  seq-chain will execute a series of .seq files.
###  Each sequence will wait until the last command
###  of the previous sequence is executed before starting.
###  Aborting parent will not affect the children after they are started
###  (But if you know which child sequence is running, you could abort the chain.)
