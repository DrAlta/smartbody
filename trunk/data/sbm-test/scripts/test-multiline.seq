0	begin echo
A multiline command begins with 'begin'
and ends with 'end'.
end

0	begin echo Everything after 'begin',
is treated as part of the command.
end

0	begin
echo Alternatively, the command
can be placed on the next line.
end

0	begin echo
The raw_remainder of a multiline command
will always include the newline characters.
This preserves formating in echo commands and XML end data


... and newlines.
end

0	begin echo
Don't forget your 'end' tags.
0	begin echo
