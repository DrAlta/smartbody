                       SmartBody Library
                     =====================

SmartBody Library is a modular, controller-based character animation
system.  Despite being called a library, SmartBody-lib is not ready for
use outside of SBM (see ..\sbm), which wraps up SmartBody into nice
VHuman compatible modular.  (VHuman is USC-ICT's distributed
architecture for virtual humans and immersive environments.)

SmartBody was built by University of Southern California's Institute for
Creative Technologies and Information Sciences Institute.
