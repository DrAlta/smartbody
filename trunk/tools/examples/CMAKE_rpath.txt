There are a few properties used to specify RPATH rules. 

INSTALL_RPATH is a semicolon-separated list specifying the rpath to use in installed targets (for platforms that support it). 

INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH is a boolean that if set to true will append directories in the linker search path and outside the project to the INSTALL_RPATH. 

SKIP_BUILD_RPATH is a boolean specifying whether to skip automatic generation of an rpath allowing the target to run from the build tree. 

BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH is a boolean specifying whether to link the target in the build tree with the INSTALL_RPATH. 
 This takes precedence over SKIP_BUILD_RPATH and avoids the need for relinking before installation. 

INSTALL_NAME_DIR is a string specifying the directory portion of the "install_name" field of shared libraries on Mac OSX to use in the installed targets. 

When the target is created, the values of the variables:

 CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH, 
 CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH, 
 CMAKE_SKIP_BUILD_RPATH, 
 CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH, and 
 CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR 
 
are used to initialize these properties.

== ==
# INSTALL_RPATH: The rpath to use for installed targets.

A semicolon-separated list specifying the rpath to use in installed targets (for platforms that support it). 

This property is initialized by the value of the variable CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH if it is set when a target is created.

==
# BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH: Should build tree targets have install tree rpaths.

BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH is a boolean specifying whether to link the target in the build tree with the INSTALL_RPATH. 

This takes precedence over SKIP_BUILD_RPATH and avoids the need for relinking before installation. 

This property is initialized by the value of the variable CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH if it is set when a target is created.

==
# INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH: Add paths to linker search and installed rpath.

INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH is a boolean that if set to true will append directories in the linker search path and outside the project to the INSTALL_RPATH. 

This property is initialized by the value of the variable CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH if it is set when a target is created.

== ====
# CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH: The rpath to use for installed targets.

A semicolon-separated list specifying the rpath to use in installed targets (for platforms that support it). 

This is used to initialize the target property INSTALL_RPATH for all targets.

==
# CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH: Use the install path for the RPATH

Normally CMake uses the build tree for the RPATH when building executables etc on systems that use RPATH. 

When the software is installed the executables etc are relinked by CMake to have the install RPATH. 

If this variable is set to true then the software is always built with the install path for the RPATH and does not need to be relinked when installed.

==
# CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH: Add paths to linker search and installed rpath.

CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH is a boolean that if set to true will append directories in the linker search path and outside the project to the INSTALL_RPATH. 

This is used to initialize the target property INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH for all targets.
