                      SBM: SmartBody Module
                    =========================

SmartBody Module is the VHuman module for character animation.  SBM
takes in BML behavior requests, via VHMsg, and outputs skeletal
animation to a renderer over a network connection called the BoneBus.

The actual character animation is handled by the SmartBody Library
(..\smartbody-lib).  At the moment, the two are strongly intertwined.

For detailed documentation, please see the SmartBody website:

SmartBody was built by University of Southern California's Institute for
Creative Technologies and Information Sciences Institute.
