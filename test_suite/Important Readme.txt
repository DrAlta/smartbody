Naming conventions:
	1. All the test case folders' name under input folder follow the format *_test.
	2. Inside that folder, if the testing is based on jpg images, the expected image name would follow the format *_test_std.jpg; if based on pure data, the expected data file name would have the format *_test_std.jpg
	3. Inside that folder, .sh file would have a format of *_test.sh
	4. Inside that folder, .seq file would have a format of *_test.seq
	5. Inside the sequence file, do not change the default output file name

For test suite writers (TODOs):
	1. remember the name convention
	2. writing sequence files
	3. writing .sh files
